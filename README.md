RestAssured.Net brings the power of <a href="https://rest-assured.io" target="_blank">REST Assured</a> to the C# / .NET ecosystem.

With RestAssured.Net, writing tests for your HTTP APIs is as simple as

```csharp
using static RestAssured.Dsl;

[Test]
public void DemonstrateRestAssuredNetEaseOfUse()
{
    Given()
    .When()
    .Get("http://api.zippopotam.us/us/90210")
    .Then()
    .StatusCode(200)
    .And()
    .Body("$.places[0].state", NHamcrest.Is.EqualTo("California"));
}
```

All features of the library are described and demonstrated in the [RestAssured.Net Usage Guide](https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-net/wiki/Usage-Guide).
